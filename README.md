## Overview

The purpose of the `Calculate_wer.py` script is to compute the Word Error Rate (WER) value. Currently, it's configured for a batch size of 1, utilizing the CPU, with 8 files specified in `manifest.json`. However, optimal performance and output are hindered due to insufficient system requirements, notably the absence of a GPU. Resolving this issue could significantly enhance performance.

## Performance Metrics

- WER: 0.0673 (Batch Size: 1, CPU, 8 files in `Manifest.json`)

## Challenges Faced

Encountered difficulties while downloading dependencies, particularly when installing Deepspeed on my machine.
